The main objective was to assess and compare members of a species complex (FGSC), with varying toxigenic potential, which cause [Fusarium head blight (FHB) or scab](https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/fungi/ascomycetes/Pages/Fusarium.aspx). Several fitness-related traits were compared in five experiments conducted both *in vitro* and in *planta*. Check the manuscript page.

## Summary of methods

A collection of 30 strains was obtained from the laboratory's FGSC collection and experiments were designed to measure traits related with asexual and sexual fungal growth, pathogenicity towards two wheat cultivars of varying susceptibility and sensitivity to tebuconazole fungicide. In most analyses, we were interested in testing the effect of species or toxing genotypes, and not the effect of individual isolates. Therefore, the isolates were treated as random sample representative of the population of strains. We used a mixed modeling approach where isolates were treated as random effects.
Data from each experiment were analyzed separately.
