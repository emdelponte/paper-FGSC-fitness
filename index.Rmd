The research's objectives were to assess and compare members of a species complex (FGSC), with varying toxigenic potential, that cause [Fusarium head blight or scab](https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/fungi/ascomycetes/Pages/Fusarium.aspx), an important disease of wheat and barley worldwide. Several fitness-related traits were compared in five experiments conducted both *in vitro* and in *planta*. Data from each experiment were analyzed separately.


## Summary of methods

A collection of 30 strains was obtained from the laboratory's FGSC collection and experiments were designed to measure traits related with asexual and sexual fungal growth, pathogenicity towards two wheat cultivars of varying susceptibility and sensitivity to tebuconazole fungicide. In most analyses, we were interested in differences among the species-genotype and not on individual isolates. Therefore, the isolates were treated as random sample representative of the population of strains. In the models, they were treated as random effects (mixed-modeling).
